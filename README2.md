Dear Mr. Thomas,

I wanted to clarify a detail regarding my project deployment.
I initially developed and deployed the project using my personal GitHub repository. Although I have pushed the complete, final codebase to the official 
GitHub Classroom repository for submission, the live Azure Web App is currently still connected to my original repository for its deployments.

The code in both repositories is identical. I hope this explains why the deployment source might appear different from the Classroom repo link.

Best regards,
Efe Melih Arpaci
